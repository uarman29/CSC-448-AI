    "In this report I used linear regression to find the correlation between two sets of values, and then I used classification in the form of a Support Vector Machine to classify my data into two groups so that I could predict which group a set of data would belong to. The methodology for Section 2 and Section 4 were almost identical. I started by loading the data from the CSV and then cleaning up missing/invalid data using pandas. Then I split my data into training data and test data. At this point for Section 4 I had to scale my data using MinMaxScaler so that each feature had equal influence. Then I simply trained/fit my respective models using the training data. For Section 2 I also included a graph. Finally, I used my test data to check how accurate each model was and then did cross validation to make sure I didnât just get lucky. From this report I found out that a day's ice cream revenue is very closely related to the temperature on that day, and I also found out that age, bmi, and gender are great predictors of whether or not someone is at a high risk for stroke. Overall, I thought it was really interesting how accurate these models could be, especially for my classification model. It really got me thinking about how AI is the future and maybe one day we will have robot doctors because my model did a pretty good job of categorizing someone as at a high risk for stroke or not. To extend this project I could do a few things like, add more features to my feature vector to make it more accurate and use different models to test out the effectiveness of each. "
